1.	 For this assignment you will be just using HTML, you can use CSS if you want but it is not expected. Please review the in-class examples and Lab 2 and 3 before you start the assignment.
2.	Create a folder Assignment 1 under your repo and first file should be named index.html

5.	Fill random values in a row using appropriate tags, values should be unique.
6.	Header Section of your webpage should have an appropriate header, Footer should have copyright information. I would keep the header as ‘Employee Record-Keeping’
7.	You must divide your page using div tags or section to keep each component separate. For example header section should have its own div, same for footer and as well for navigation and table.
8.	The left section of your webpage should have 3 hyperlinks, one link pointing to address.html,  name.html, and dob.html.
9.	Now in address.html should only show the address you had in the index page, and display it using the ordered list. The address should be same as what you had in index page and in the same order.
10.	Now in the name.html should only show the name you had in the index page, and display it using the ordered list. The name should be same as what you had in index page and in the same order.
11.	Now in the dob.html should only show the date of birth values you had in the index page, and display it using the table. The name should be the same as what you had in the index page and in the same order.
12.	All the 4 pages should have a header, footer, navigation, and middle section which has the main content. All the pages should be linked, for example from index I can navigate to other 3 pages, same from dob.html I should be able to navigate to other 3 pages. 
13.	All the div tags you use should have a unique HTML ‘id’ attribute.
14.	Once you are done, now in the index page do add a logo of your choice on the right side of your header and do add the logo for all pages.
15.	Now choose 10 different Html elements which we haven’t covered in the class and do apply them in your index page. The new HTML elements should be between table and footer and do have separate div tags and id for them as well.
16.	Validate your webpage, make sure there are no errors and push your code to BB, publish it to Loki and complete the reflection via slack (#assignment).
