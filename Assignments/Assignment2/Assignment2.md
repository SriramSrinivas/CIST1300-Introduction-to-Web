 # CIST1300-001 (Assignment 2, Due 04/06/2020 @11:59 PM)
## For this assignment, you can use HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. (Don't use Java Script, you will use it for Assignment 3)

# Assignment:- 
1.	Create a new folder “Assignment2” inside your repo. 
2.	Now design a webpage, which allows users to take the online quiz.  There should be at least 15 questions.
3.	10 out of 15 questions should be multiple choice questions (minimum 4 options), 4 questions should be true and false, 
and 1 question should allow users to type their answers.
4. #Skip (The user should answer all the questions, if a user doesn’t answer any question, ensure that once a user hits submit button  user should get an alert via modal window saying “All questions should be answered” to proceed.  --Skip this step for assignment 2, you will do this step when you work on assignment 3.)
5.	For all your questions please use the https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/collapse/  recommended Accordion.   
When the page loads all the questions by default will not be visible, once a user clicks the button or question number, 
the question and answer section for that question will be visible.  
The example is shown in the bootstrap component and there will be example code provided along with the assignment.
6.	Please do add a progress bar on top of the quiz, which should show the user how much progress has been made. 
This assignment I just expect you to have the progress bar on top no need to update it. 
In assignment 3 and future once we learn javascript and Jquery we will make the progress bar dynamic.
7.	Testing- For all the multiple choice questions 5 for this assignment, please ensure the user can select only one answer and 
do comment the correct answer for the instructor to test your website.
8.	Complete the reflection via slack and do make sure that the code is pushed and the website can be accessed via Loki. Slack channel for reflection- #assignment2-

Assignment 2 sample code can be found at  https://bitbucket.org/sriramsrinivas/cist1300-sriramsrinivas/src/master/Assignment%202%20Sample/.
