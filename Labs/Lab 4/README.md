## Lab 4 Bootstrap

Step 1:- Create a new folder “Lab4” inside your cist repository, next
copy all the files from Lab3

Step 2:- Create a new page contactme.html, and use anchor link to
connect from the other 3 pages, please make sure all 4 pages have a link
to connect other pages.

Step 3:- Now inside contactme.html page add the bootstrap CDN links
and make sure that bootstrap gets loaded in the browser when you test
your page locally.

Step4:- Now be creative, get all the information from a user such as a
name, phone number, email, address and any message for you. For
message please use the text area.

Step 5:- For all the fields have an appropriate validator, make sure if a
user enters the incorrect value give the message.

Step 6:- Now once the user submits a form prompt a modal window and
show a message ( more instructions about this will be provided in the
class).

Step 7:- Now inside Lab4 create a new HTML page, no need to link
with other pages, now select 10 different unique bootstrap components
which we haven’t covered in the class and you haven’t used in the
contact page. For each component use the bootstrap grid system and add
them.

reflection.
