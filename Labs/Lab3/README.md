# LAB 3

1.	Inside your CIST1300-001, create a folder “Lab 3” and inside the folder create two html files index.html and aboutme.html

2.	Here is a chance to be creative, the previous class we discussed HTML elements, remember www.w3schools.com is your friend. You can check out that link and see which elements you can use.

3.	In the index.html web page, create a hyperlink (<a href=""> </a>) link to connect to aboutme.html page

### Do also add the following meta tag for making your website responsive
 
{{<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">}}

 4.	The more you use HTML elements it will give you confidence. Ideally, a aboutme page should have information such as your name, address, phone, some introduction statement about yourself, your skill sets, your education, and work experience  As this is an opportunity for you to be creative, please use the proper HTML elements and attribute and design your webpage.

6.	Once you are done, stop here ask for feedback from the instructor, I will review your webpage in local, and quickly glance your content and your code. I will provide you with my feedback, and you can decide if you want to change.


7. Add a new HTML file, name it whatever you like, but make sure it has an extension .html, next have a href link connecting all 3 pages, page1 should have links to 2 and 3, similarly page 2 should have links to 1,3 and finally page 3 should have links to 1 and 2.

8.choose a background color, and make sure all 3 pages have consistent background color. 

9.  Add some relevant content to the new web page you created.

10. Let’s make all the pages responsive in Webstorm by adding the HTML meta tag, we discussed in this lecture.

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

11. For all HTML elements add HTML attribute id and class, if you want the same CSS for multiple HTML elements, do add class.

## Now let’s add the CSS style sheet, and define your CSS for HTML elements.



Step 11 can be done in multiple ways, I am ok whichever style you choose, however for Lab4 all elements for both HTML pages should have a style, it can be unique or different.


## Test your website after adding CSS locally

Add CSS properties which we haven’t covered, refer to the links provided when we discussed the CSS in the class. In order to earn full credit, please have around 15 unique CSS properties and should be relevant to the page.  

15 unique CSS can be divided across the 3 pages.

12. Now if everything is good locally, sync your code which means commit and push to Bit Bucket and publish in loki.

13. If everything is good, please see if it is responsive, by checking it on your smartphone. If you don’t have smartphone check responsiveness using Google chrome inspect element. Take a screenshot and send me via slack direct message.


14.  Validate your HTML page, if there are issues or error fix them. Use the Chrom HTML plugin to inspect. If there are warnings, you can ignore them.

15. The final step, please update the Slack channel with your Lab 3 reflection. Don’t post your reflection in the general channel. I have a separate channel for Lab 3, please post your reflection over there. Reflections are counted towards Lab 3 grading.



## Lab 3 reflection guidelines- Lab 3 reflection, please share your feedback about Lab 3, what you think is good, and bad about Lab 3. Please share your thoughts about CSS and responsive websites.
