## LAB 3

1.	Inside your CIST1300-001, create a folder “Lab 3” and inside the folder create two html files index.html and aboutme.html

2.	Here is a chance to be creative, the previous class we discussed HTML elements, remember www.w3schools.com is your friend. You can check out that link and see which elements you can use.

3.	In the index.html web page, create an anchor link to connect to aboutme.html page

4.	Grading for this lab is purely based on how you use HTML elements, and I am ok if the website looks ugly. This lab will be further extended in the future to use CSS, where you can make your website beautiful. This lab aims to get you hands-on practice on writing HTML page from scratch, so I expect you to use HTML elements, which we covered in class and beyond. 

5.	The more you use HTML elements it will give you confidence. Ideally, a aboutme page should have information such as your name, address, phone, some introduction statement about yourself, your skill sets, your education, and work experience  As this is an opportunity for you to be creative, please use the proper HTML elements and attribute and design your webpage.

6.	Once you are done, stop here ask for feedback from the instructor, I will review your webpage in local, and quickly glance your content and your code. I will provide you with my feedback, and you can decide if you want to change.

7.	Once you are ready and tested your code and push it to loki and git

8.	There are chances we might encounter rendering issues, such as content might not be displayed correctly in Loki, don’t panic let's troubleshoot. Google chrome inspect is your friend to troubleshoot, please let the instructor know if you see any rendering issues I can assist.

9.	Now if your website doesn’t have any issues, good let's check out the website in your smartphone browser using the same URL you used in your desktop. Finally, I want you to visit our class slack channel and join Lab3, and post your reflection about lab3 if you see any difference in HTML webpage while using your smartphone browser.  ,
** Lab3 reflection I expect you to mention what you liked about Lab3, what you didn’t like, how can we further improve lab3 ?***
